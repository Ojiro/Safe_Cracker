Safecracker:

The objective of this game is to score as much loot as possible by breaking into safes. 
To break into a safe, you must figure out the combination before the cops arrive. If you don't break the safe in time, the cops
will bust you, and you will have to bail out, if you can't bail out...game over.

There are several versions of this game:

Safecracker is the original, text-based game. 
Megacracker is the upgraded text version.
Gigacracker is the GUI enhanced version.
